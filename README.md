## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built using Laravel's Observer pattern and Elasticsearch, providing a clean separation of concerns:

```
app/
├── Observers/     # Model observers for activity tracking
├── Services/      # Business logic and Elasticsearch interactions
├── Jobs/          # Background jobs for async processing
├── Providers/     # Service providers for system setup
└── config/        # Configuration files
```
